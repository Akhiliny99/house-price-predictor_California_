# house-price-predictor_California_

Built an end-to-end machine learning web app that predicts 
California house prices with 85.2% accuracy.

What I did:
- Analyzed 20,640 real housing records (EDA)
- Engineered 4 new features that became the top model predictors
- Trained and compared 6 ML models (Linear Regression → XGBoost)
- Deployed as a live interactive web app using Streamlit

Tech Stack: Python, XGBoost, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Plotly, Streamlit
